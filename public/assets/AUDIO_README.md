# Audio Files

This portfolio uses audio effects for enhanced user experience:

## Required Audio Files

- `text.wav` - Sound effect for loading screen text animation ✅
- `notifikasi.mp3` - Sound effect for EQbot notifications ✅  
- `backsound.mp3` - Background music (optional) ❌

## Background Music (Optional)

The `backsound.mp3` file was removed due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit. 

### To add background music:

1. Place a small audio file (recommended: < 5MB) as `backsound.mp3` in this folder
2. Supported formats: MP3, OGG, WAV
3. The floating audio controller will automatically appear when the file is available

### Recommendations for background music:

- **File size**: Under 5MB for optimal loading
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes (will loop automatically) 
- **Genre**: Ambient, lo-fi, or soft instrumental
- **Volume**: The system will auto-adjust to 30% volume

If no background music file is provided, the portfolio will work perfectly without it - only the loading and notification sound effects will play.
